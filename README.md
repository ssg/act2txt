# act2txt
Tool to convert Adobe Photoshop ACT palette files to Paint.NET TXT format. 
This was something I needed and I used it as an excuse to write some code 
in C# 10 top-level format. 

You can install it using the command:

```
dotnet tool install -g act2txt
```

# usage
```
act2txt inputfile outputfile
```

Example:

```
act2txt somepalette.act someplaette.txt
```
